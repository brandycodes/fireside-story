      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>and there was a knock at the door...</p>
      <p>She sighed and looked up from her laptop. Who could be here at this hour?</p>
      <p>Setting the laptop aside, she activated the trap door under the front mat, nodding as she heard a clunk in the basement.</p>
      <p>She listened for noises of surprise from below, from either the knocker or her pet, Fluffy.</p>
      <p>She looked up as fluffy scampered over, towering over her, jumping up and down with excitement.</p>
